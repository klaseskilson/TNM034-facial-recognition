Face recognition is a difficult subject to master. Facial features need to be detected, extracted and normalized. This is followed by the recognition progress where the candidate image needs to be compared to the faces in an existing database within reasonable computer resources. This report will describe an implementation based on Eigenfaces and preprocessing with gray world assumption and histogram equalization. The system was tested with both distorted images and other images of faces both in the reference database and not with varying results which was gathered.  The resulting program was a facial recognition system that had varying result depending on the challenges it was presented with. With evenly illuminated, non-distorted and clutter-free images, the program performed well. A discussion of what could have been improved is provided.
