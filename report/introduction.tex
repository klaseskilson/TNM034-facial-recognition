The art of detecting faces and recognizing them is a part of our everyday life. Facial recognition is used in authentication systems for phones and laptops. With the increasing personal information stored on these devices, the need for the security and reliance of the recognition has to be increased as well. We also expect the recognition to work with any conditions in regard of lighting and geometric distortions. With results and methods from the research area of image processing, the implication of these conditions can be eliminated or their effect decreased.
