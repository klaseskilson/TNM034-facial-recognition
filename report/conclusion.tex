The face recognition process is something that a lot of research and time is put into. As stated in the beginning of this report a face that needs to be recognized could be rotated, have different illumination or a different scale than the reference image. Our implementation works for some of the images that have been changed, but it has been proven for us that it is very hard to implement a waterproof system.

Some improvements that could be implemented have been discussed. Mainly Fisherfaces could probably vastly improve the process, we do however not have that many training faces that seems to necessary for that implementation. Other methods that could improve our implementation also is for example the LogAbout method. This has been implemented but the results we achieved did not improve our implementation. There are reports that show the LogAbout method improving recognition rate however.
