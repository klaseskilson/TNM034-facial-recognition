The face recognition process is something that a lot of research and time is put into. As stated in the beginning of this report a face that needs to be recognized could be rotated, have different illumination or a different scale than the reference image. The implementation suggested in this article works for some of the images that have been changed, but it has been proven that it is hard to implement a waterproof system. 

Some improvements that could be made have been discussed. Fisherfaces could probably vastly improve the process, we do however not have that many training faces that seems to be necessary for that implementation. Other methods that also could improve our implementation is for example the LogAbout method. This has been implemented but the results we achieved did not improve our implementation. There are reports that show the LogAbout method improving recognition rate however.

Overall the art of face recognition is something very hard to implement in a dynamic way for real life usage.
